| **[Autonomous navigation system on ROSbot 2.0](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/blob/master/Autonomous%20navigation%20system%20on%20ROSbot%202.0/Navigation_Group_Report.pdf)** | **An autonomous navigation system in ROSbot 2.0 for a project. The system, which utilizes a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS receiver, a PID controller, and a Rplidar sensor, was designed to autonomously follow predefined waypoints and gather environmental data. While the robot was mostly successful, its accuracy varied with environment and weather conditions, which obstructed the GNSS receiver's signal. |
| **[IONIZING RADIATION DETECTOR](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/ALFA-BETA-GAMMA-PARTICLE-IMAGE-PROCESSING)** | The incident particles or radiations interact with the sensor material and ionize it. The absorbed energy inside the sensor material is used to generate electron- hole pairs. These electrons and holes can be collected as electrical signals. The collected charges are processed by read-out or front-end electronics. |
| **[GUI Interface Design of Common Algorithms of Signal Processing Based on MATLAB](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/GUI%20Interface%20Design%20of%20Common%20Algorithms%20of%20Signal%20Processing%20Based%20on%20MATLAB)** | **Comprehensive use GUI interface design, various function calls to voice signals such as frequency, amplitude, Fourier transform and filtering, the program interface concise, simple, has some significance in practice.** |
| **[Instrumented-glove-for-fingers-movement-tracking](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/PCB%20Project/PCB-Projects)** | **Design a PCB for Inertial sensors system that embedded into gloves to track the fingers movement with high accuracy and high real-time response.** |
| **[Simple LOT](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/Sensor%20Network/submit%20WSN%20code)** | **In this application, the transport is based on the UDP(User datagram protocol),the network is based on IPV6 .** |
| **[Simple embedded system](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/mbed_project)** | **Mbed platform , temperature sensor ,LCD screen, interrupts etc...** |
| [**Physical Modeling of Embedded Systems**](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/Physical%20Modeling%20of%20Embedded%20Systems) | **Perform advanced spice modelling of coupled effects in electronic circuits.** |
| **[Radon detection](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/Radon%20detection)** | **Build a circuit for detecting radon elements**             |
| **[SOC](https://github.com/hhhtzq/Electronics-related-projects/tree/master/SOC)** | **System on chip**                                           |
