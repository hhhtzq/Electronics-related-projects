# Challenges
Design a smallest PCB for every sensor unit, and consider how to connect every sensors which allocated in every finger joints . It also should care wear comfortable and low in cost. 

# Step 1
Design the schematic based on the 9-Axis MPU and the microcontroller. 

####  Completed the design of MPU-9250 schematic and PCB(Ziqin)
