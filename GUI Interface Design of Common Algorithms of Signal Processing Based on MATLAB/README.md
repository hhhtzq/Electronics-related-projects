The process of the entire signal processing system is roughly divided into two steps. First, read the analog signal to be processed, and then perform the processing of the read signal, including information extraction, amplitude and frequency transformation, and signal Fourier transformation, filtering, etc.; Filtering includes low-pass filtering, high-pass filtering, band-pass filtering, and band-stop filtering. Finally, the effect of processing the processed signal is displayed.

##### 2.Theory

| Concept                                 | Reference                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time domain analysis                    | A time domain analysis is an analysis of physical signals, mathematical functions, or time series of economic or environmental data, in reference to time. Also, in the time domain, the signal or function's value is understood for all real numbers at various separate instances in the case of discrete-time or the case of continuous-time.<br/><br/>Time domain analysis provides the transitory response of a system to be analyzed, and it permits a better understanding of the flow of both mechanical and electrical energies. In general, this includes wave propagation, the structural changes of a system, and electric potential generated by external excitations. |
| Amplitude spectrum                      | [*Digital signal Processing*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781904275268/digital-signal-processing) |
| Power spectrum                          | The simple explanation is that the power spectrum describes the distribution of signal power in the frequency domain. |
| Frequency aliasing                      | ![](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/97ac5e716e1324fb2298f8de35be4565074820ed)<br/>This analysis can be extended to many sinusoids of different frequencies. In particular, the discrete time series derived from a too coarse sampling (undersampling) of a continuous signal actually contains contributions from high-frequency components of that continuous signal. Those high frequencies fold back onto the spectrum of the discrete time series and appear as lower frequencies. The phenomenon that is caused by undersampling the continuous signal is termed *frequency aliasing*. |
| Spectrum leakage                        | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_leakage)  |
| Fence effect                            | Because the DFT calculation spectrum is limited to the spectrum at an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency F0, rather than a continuous frequency function, this phenomenon that the real scene can only be seen at discrete points is called the *fence effect*.<br/>One way to reduce the fence effect is to make frequency domain sampling more dense, that is, increase the number of frequency domain sampling points N. Without changing the time domain data, it is necessary to add some zero points at the end of the time domain data to make it within a period The number of points is increased, but the original recorded data is not changed. |
| Discretization of Fourier integral      | Since the Fourier transform cannot be used for logical operations with digital computers, in engineering analysis, sampling is usually used to observe some discrete values of x(t), and then use numerical integration to discretize the Fourier transform. |
