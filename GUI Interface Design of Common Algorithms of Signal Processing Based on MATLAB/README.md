The process of the entire signal processing system is roughly divided into two steps. First, read the analog signal to be processed, and then perform the processing of the read signal, including information extraction, amplitude and frequency transformation, and signal Fourier transformation, filtering, etc.; Filtering includes low-pass filtering, high-pass filtering, band-pass filtering, and band-stop filtering. Finally, the effect of processing the processed signal is displayed.
