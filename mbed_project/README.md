## EXERCISE

* exercise 1
  > used joystick center to switch mode 
* exercise 2
  > used RGB LED as a warn light
* exercise 3
  > used I2C to measure the temperature and show on the computer
* exercise 4
  > react to external and internal events that trigger interrupts. 
  > measure time periods with the help of timers.   
* exercise 5
  > used display bitmaps code to build two images and show the real-time  temperature variation in the coordinate axis


## PROJECT

- Measure the temperature.
- Misplay the temperature on the computer and the LCD screen.
- When the temperature is higher than 30°C, the red breathing LED will turn on.
- When the temperature is lower than 26°C, the blue breathing LED will turn on.
- When the temperature is between 30 and 28, we can push the joycenter button and the “sun” image will show on the LCD screen.
- When the temperature is between 28 and 26, we can push the  joycenter button and  the “rain” image will show on the LCD screen.
- When the temperature is lower than 26, we can push the joycenter button and the “snow” image will show on the LCD screen.
